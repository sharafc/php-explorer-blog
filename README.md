# Learning PHP with a blog

Initial version needed to be done with some not-standard compliant coding conventions and debugging methodology which I did only partially use. Rest should be PSR compliant.

## Prospect

In the future:
* want to change everything completely to a more modular approach and PSR
* switch everything to OOP


Version 2:
Switched to OOP and MVC, still on Tutors demise.
